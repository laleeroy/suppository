This repository is for the former docker container "suppository" which existed as a full toolchain to compile homebrew for the Nintendo Switch, and now is instead for a general GIT workflow atmosphere release suite.

The following commands can be used to compile atmosphere, and output the compiled release (release .zip and fusee.bin) it in the directory you run the command from:


Current example below is the build instructions that produce atmosphere 1.8.0 (22nd of october 2024), note the "haze" and "daybreak" .nro's are made before atmosphere because of issues with paralell thread makes in atmospheres's codebase.


note as of 24.10.2024: the docker container on dockerhub borntohonk/suppository, is deprecated until it otherwise would be needed again as devkitpro/devkita64 is now viable to compile atmosphere.

```

sudo docker pull devkitpro/devkita64:latest

sudo docker run --name suppository \
 --rm \
 --volume $PWD/.:/out \
 devkitpro/devkita64:latest /bin/bash -c \
 "cd /build && \
 git clone https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/libnx.git && \

 git -C libnx checkout 1900_support && \

below are instructions that instead use build.sh and pack.sh from this repository, which additionally bundles hekate, hbl, hbmenu, atmosphere and tegraexplorer, as well as some configs, such as exosphere.ini and dnsmitm.


```
sudo docker pull devkitpro/devkita64:latest

sudo docker run --name suppository \
 --rm \
 --volume $PWD/.:/out \
 devkitpro/devkita64:latest /bin/bash -c \
 "cd /build && \
 wget https://github.com/borntohonk/suppository/raw/refs/heads/master/build.sh && \
 wget https://github.com/borntohonk/suppository/raw/refs/heads/master/pack.sh && \
 sh ./build.sh"
